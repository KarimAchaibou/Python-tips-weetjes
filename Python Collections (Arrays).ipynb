    "# Python Collections (Arrays)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:\n",
    "\n",
    "    List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.\n",
    "    Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.\n",
    "    Set is a collection which is unordered and unindexed. No duplicate members.\n",
    "    Dictionary is a collection which is unordered, changeable and indexed. No duplicate members.\n",
    "\n",
    "When choosing a collection type, it is useful to understand the properties of that type. Choosing the right type for a particular data set could mean retention of meaning, and, it could mean an increase in efficiency or security.\n",
    "List\n",
    "\n",
    "# List\n",
    "\n",
    "A list is a collection which is ordered and changeable. In Python lists are written with square brackets.\n",
    "Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a List:\n",
    "thislist = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
    "print(thislist)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Tuple\n",
    "\n",
    "A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. In Python tuples are written with round brackets.\n",
    "Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a Tuple:\n",
    "thistuple = (\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\")\n",
    "print(thistuple)\n",
    "\n",
    "output: ('apple', 'banana', 'cherry')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Set\n",
    "\n",
    "A set is a collection which is unordered and unindexed. In Python sets are written with curly brackets.\n",
    "Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a Set:\n",
    "thisset = {\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"}\n",
    "print(thisset) \n",
    "\n",
    "output: {'banana', 'apple', 'cherry'}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "A dictionary is a collection which is unordered, changeable and indexed. In Python dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and they have keys and values.\n",
    "Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Create and print a dictionary:\n",
    "thisdict =\t{\n",
    "  \"brand\": \"Ford\",\n",
    "  \"model\": \"Mustang\",\n",
    "  \"year\": 1964\n",
    "}\n",
    "print(thisdict)\n",
    "\n",
    "output: {'brand': 'Ford', 'model': 'Mustang', 'year': 1964}"
